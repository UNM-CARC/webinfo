# Open Office and Consultation Hours

---
The Center for Advanced Research Computing offers weekly office hours. We are here to help you with any questions or issues you have related to CARC and look forward to meeting with you.  

## Open Office Hours
Open office hours are first-come-first-served so there may be a delay in seeing you, but we are usually able to see everyone who comes.

- Wednesdays from 10:00 to 11:00am and Thursdays from 2:00 to 3:00pm MT [https://unm.zoom.us/j/4232179831](https://unm.zoom.us/j/4232179831).  
Matthew Fricke, Research Assistant Professor ([mfricke@unm.edu](mailto://mfricke@unm.edu))  

## Consultation Hours

- Thursdays at 10:00-11:00am I will hold consultation hours. These are intended to accomodate longer discussions with a single user or group. Consulations must be booked in advance by emailing mfricke@unm.edu.
  
Consultation and Open Office hours are only available on Zoom. Due to increasing demand we cannot accomodate special appointment times.
