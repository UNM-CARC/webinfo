## Office Hours

---
The Center for Advanced Research Computing offers weekly office hours where CARC users can come for help. Office hours are first-come-first-served so there may be a delay in seeing you, but we are usually able to see everyone who comes.

Office Hours with Prof. Matthew Fricke are on Wednesdays from 10:00 to 11:00am and Thursdays from 2:00 to 3:00pm MT via Zoom. The Zoom link is [https://unm.zoom.us/j/4232179831](https://unm.zoom.us/j/4232179831).

In person visits at CARC 1112 are by appointment only. Please email help@carc.unm.edu to arrange a time.

On Tuesdays, office hours are held by System analysts Kevin Fotso and Tannor Brown from 01:00 to 02:00pm MT via Zoom. The link for those office hours is https://unm.zoom.us/j/99653166024.

Before you attend please email Matthew at mfricke@unm.edu or Kevin at kfotsotagne@unm.edu to let us know to expect you.

If none of these zoom meeting times are convenient please send an email to help@carc.unm.edu to make an appointment.
