OFFICE AND CONSULTATION HOURS ARE CLOSED UNTIL JANUARY 3RD 2024.

# Open Office and Consultation Hours
The Center for Advanced Research Computing offers weekly office hours. We are here to help you with any questions or issues you have related to CARC and look forward to meeting with you.  

Consultation and Open Office hours are only available on Zoom. Due to increasing demand we cannot accomodate special appointment times. Please connect to the Zoom session using a computer rather than a phone.

## Open Office Hours
Open office hours are first-come-first-served so there may be a delay in seeing you, but we are usually able to see everyone who comes.
